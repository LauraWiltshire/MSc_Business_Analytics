This repository contains code and data visualisations for my MSc project titled: **"Developing Predictive Models for Care Quality Commission Inspection Ratings in Adult Social Care"**.

## Project Summary
The project investigates the use of supervised machine learning algorithms to predict Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspection outcomes for adult social care providers, using a dataset from Bath and North East Somerset Council.
Due to ethical and data protection constraints, the full dataset is not included in this repository.

## Data Collection
**Please Note:** Commissioner data is not publicly available and will not be uploaded due to data protection and sensitivity.
